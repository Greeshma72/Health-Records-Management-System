# Health-Records-Management-System
Project Overview:

This project is a Health Records Management System that manages and analyzes healthcare datasets. It includes functionalities for loading, cleaning, and performing basic exploratory data analysis on healthcare data, including patients' medical conditions, admission details, and billing information.

Features:

Data loading from CSV files.
Exploratory data analysis using Pandas and NumPy.
Visualization of data insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Analysis of patient records including medical conditions, hospital details, and insurance information.

Technologies Used:
Python
 Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Google Colab (optional for running the project in the cloud)



Setup and Installation
Clone the repository (or download the project files).


git clone <repository-url>
Install the necessary libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Load the dataset: Place your healthcare dataset in the working directory and modify the file path in the script as needed:


df = pd.read_csv('healthcare_dataset.csv')
Run the script: You can execute the script either locally or on Google Colab:

For local execution, simply run the Python file using:

python <script_name>.py
For execution on Google Colab, ensure that you mount Google Drive if accessing the dataset from there:

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')


Data Exploration and Analysis:

The dataset includes key fields such as:

Patient Information: Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type
Medical Details: Medical Condition, Medication, Test Results
Hospitalization: Admission Date, Discharge Date, Room Number, Admission Type
Financial: Billing Amount, Insurance Provider

Example code for data exploration:

df.head()  # View the first few records
df.describe()  # Summary statistics of the data
df.info()  # Information on data types and missing values

Visualization:

The project includes visualizations to understand the distribution of medical conditions, patient demographics, and hospital admission trends.

Sample code for generating visualizations:

# Example visualization of medical conditions distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.countplot(data=df, x='Medical Condition')
plt.title('Distribution of Medical Conditions')
plt.show()
